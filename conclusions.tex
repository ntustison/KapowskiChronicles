\section{Discussion}

%Each test in the metrics
%
%We probably need a discussion section explaining why we chose each metric 
%
%Gender ... Brain extraction
%
%Brain age ... Bxt & affine reg and gm probs
%
%Constellations ... Segmentation & thickness 
%
%Repeatability ... thickness
%
%And what these metrics mean ... 
%
%I guess the networks "validate" thickness so maybe that's how we motivate them.



\section{Conclusions}

Imaging biomarkers such as cortical thickness play an 
important role in neuroscience research.  Extremely useful to
researchers are robust software tools for generating such 
biomarkers.  In this work we detailed our open source offering for estimating
cortical thickness directly from T1 images and demonstrated
its utility on a large collection of public brain data from
multiple databases acquired at multiple sites.  To our knowledge
this study constitutes the largest collection of cortical
thickness data processed in a single study.  
We expect that public availability of our tools and extensive tuning on 
the specified cohorts will prove useful to the larger
research community.  

In this work, we only explored a portion of the potentially
interesting investigations possible with these data.  However,
since all these data are publicly available, further work can
be easily pursued by us or even other interested groups.  We 
note that in addition to making the scripts, csv result files,
and cortical thickness maps available to researchers, 
posterior probability images are also offered permitting additional
quantification such as voxel-based morphometry \citep{ashburner2000}.
